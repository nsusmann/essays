## Ancient Greek Processions
<br>
Ancient Greeks often displayed their piety via performance: creating and maintain sanctuaries, sacrifices, festivals, etc.[^1] Religious processions were perhaps the biggest spectacle, and a highly anticipated event on every ancient Greek’s calendar. Many different people walked in the procession -- musicians, singers, and richly dressed priests and priestesses – and they might escort votive gifts or carry cultic equipment.[^2] Depending on the procession’s devotee, certain residents might be honored with the opportunity to process as well.[^3]  This noisy, colorful crowd wound themselves through the city until they arrived at a sanctuary, ready to honor the deity.[^4] 
<br>
We can piece together this narrative using different evidence. Religious processions were in-motion, short-term events, so we can't excavate them. Luckily, ==ancient Greek artists=={Q1747618} captured generic processional scenes on pottery, ==sculptural friezes=={Q3087894}, and painted plaques. There's also the different votive objects and remains of sacrifice, excavated from different sanctuaries -- but it's difficult to know whether they were deposited after a procession. [Ancient authors](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/definitionlookup?type=begin&q=procession&lang=greek) described processions in detail: we hear about colorful fabric, huge crowds, musicians, and food.[^5] But, these authors were mostly elite men, and they do not accurately represent everyone in attendance. 
<br>
Without a wide range of perspectives represented, it is difficult to address sensory impact, and whether participants (those walking in the procession) and spectators (those watching) experienced the procession differently.[^6] To address these questions, ==archaeologists can draw comparisons with the modern world=={Q7181384}.[^7] We’re going to look at a religious procession in Nonantum, Massachusetts.   
<br>
## The St Mary of Carmen Festa in Nonantum, Massachusetts
<br>
Every July, the [St Mary of Carmen Society](https://www.stmaryofcarmen.org/) hosts a multi-day [Italian-American Festa](https://www.stmaryofcarmen.org/festival/) in ==Nonantum, Massachusetts=={Q7049184}. Like most Italian-American Festas, the St Mary of Carmen Festa combines a religious procession with secular, family-friendly events.[^8] There's a multi-day carnival and concert series in Hawthorn Park, and all proceeds fund their [scholarship](https://www.stmaryofcarmen.org/scholarships/) and grants-in-aid programs. 
<br>
We’re going to focus primarily on the procession, logically dedicated to Saint Mary of Carmen. The procession happens on the last day of the Festa. The society carries Saint Mary’s statue out of [Our Lady Help of Christians Church](https://goo.gl/maps/MPX4y1ypvEnBj6fK7). They push the statue through the streets of Nonantum; about two hours later, they arrive at the carnival. The statue travels through the gates, eventually resting underneath a custom wooden shed. Later that night, the statue is returned to the church. After fireworks and the [“Flying Angel” ceremony](https://youtu.be/jUrH_XPml58), the statue is carried back into the church basement, where it rests until the next summer.[^9]

## 'Reading' Ancient Processional Scenes
<br>
Try and immerse yourself into the processional scenes below. Think about specific sensory experiences you might encounter, based on the different objects, people, animals, and scenery:

The processions appear calm and quiet. There are no musicians, no crowds, no noisy activity along the street. Watching the procession pass by, spectators could easily pick out different groups of people. Specific people had specific jobs, and they walk alongside their peers. Even the animals seem peaceful and unbothered -- except for this one bull.

<br><br>
These hushed, tranquil processions are unrealistic, for many reasons. Artists could apply different techniques to direct viewers' attention and highlight specific parts of the scene. Different from the real-life procession, processional art might show fewer participants or even exclude whole groups of people. Sizes of people, objects, and deities expanded or contracted to convey their importance.[^10] Pottery painters could make pieces revering specific deities, or they could use nondescript, generic imagery suitable for multiple festivals.[^11] Artists also negotiated with new technology and trends. For example, the new ==red figure pottery style=={Q633683} appeared around 530 B.C.E., and it was all about intricacy. Religious pottery painting shifted: instead of processional scenes, artists showed [a few people sacrificing around an altar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsusmann/media/main/Pothos/Red_Figure_Crater_by_Pothos.jpg).[^12]

## Saint Mary of Carmen Procession                      
<p>These artists weren't thinking about future archaeologists and their research questions. They created these scenes for other Greeks, and for the gods -- and they all knew what a processional environment was like. The Saint Mary of Carmen procession will help us imagine some of those missing sensory details.<p style="text-align: left;"><iframe style="float: right; width: 640 px; height: 480px;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=10zPJkjqhGCpB3bQN9Ohnu13euooShIE&ehbc=2E312F" width="700" height="100" frameborder="700" marginheight="700"></iframe></p><br>  
<p>Around 12 PM, I arrived at Our Lady Help of Christians Church. Society members were getting ready for the procession. The first step was bringing the Saint Mary of Carmen statue out of the church's basement. They worked together, supporting the heavy statue down the steps and onto the sidewalk. </p>
<br>
<p>They adorn her with necklaces, strung with money and prayer cards; they put a crown on her head. A small group of girls watched, alongside older relatives and friends. The girls excitedly compared their summer dresses and waved their carnations in the air.</p>   
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsusmann/media/main/SaintMaryCarmen/Statue.jpg" title="Saint Mary of Carmen Society setting up the statue" width="700"  />
        </p>
<br> 
Statue in-tow, this small group walked around to the rear parking lot. A comparatively larger, noisier crowd was already starting to assemble. There was a marching band, police escort, and some firemen carrying POW MIA flags. There were local political representatives and elected school officials wearing their swag and carrying signs. Relatives of society members –decked in red, green, and white “The Lake” gear – were cheerfully socializing, organizing, and setting up. Some of them climbed into the back of a pickup truck, rigged with a bell.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsusmann/media/main/SaintMaryCarmen/BellTruck.jpg" title="Nonantum's Alderman bell" width="700"    />        
</p>
<br>
I waited to hear someone call out instructions, but there were none. Suddenly, the music began, the bell began chiming, and the loud crowd began to walk. Certain groups – the band, the bell truck, the statue bearers – stuck together. Society members carrying donation buckets spread out. Everyone else in the procession – the campaigners, relatives, etc. – filled spaces in-between. It was emotive and festive – just like an ancient Greek procession.
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br><br>
In these first few moments, it was easy to distinguish spectators from participants. The street was a like a stage, and spectators waved and cheered to us from the sidewalk. They were loud; the band and bells were louder.
<br><br>
<p float="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsusmann/media/main/SaintMaryCarmen/Procession.jpg" title= "Saint Mary of Carmen procession" width="450"  />
&nbsp; &nbsp;
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsusmann/media/main/SaintMaryCarmen/Tapestry.jpg" title="Saint Mary of Carmen procession, showing Society members" width="450" />
<br><br>
About 1/3 of the way down the street, I noticed a change. Speakers boomed from the sidewalks; complicated firecracker displays were lit in driveways. Spectators were everywhere: walking alongside the procession, on the sidewalk, and across lawns. There were no divisions separating spectators and participants. Spectators walked up to the Society members to donate money, snap photos, and take prayer cards. Society members hopped out of the procession to take breaks, accept food, or greet friends and family.
<br>
Ancient Greek artists rarely showed spectators in processional imagery. The Parthenon frieze is one exception; a small group of elite-looking men lean on their walking sticks and casually watch the parade pass by. On the one hand, excluding spectators helped to reduce distractions and sharpened the image. On the other hand, further distanced these scenes from reality. Spectators were a critical part of the event. A massive crowd helped convey reverence to the god; they represented the community’s collective piety.[^14] </p>
<br>
## Sensing the Procession
In ancient Greece, religious processions were, in essence, performances. When artists depicted these performances, they fixated on the role of spectator. The procession happens on a stage; we are spectators, and not enfolded amongst the participants. 
<br>
Nonantum challenges us to think about Greek processions, especially spectators, who are largely invisible in these artistic depictions. Watching a live procession, I could see spectators in action. Spectators shouted, laughed, talked; hugged; cooked food and made backyard fires; played music and set off firecrackers; felt and reacted to the summer heat. Spectators were very much part of the spectacle.
<br>
The archaeological record separates spectators from participants, but we need to think: how did these boundaries blur?

[^3]: For example, local girls and boys marched in the Artemis procession at Ephesus, and families used this opportunity to make marriage alliances. Athens’ infamous Panathenaia showcased daughters from influential families, and together they carried their enormous handmade peplos for the Athena statue ([Price et al. 1999, 30-33](https://worldcat.org/en/title/39679284)). If tied to a theater festival, processions included choregoi, the wealthy citizens who funded the competition ([Pedley 2005, 79-80](https://worldcat.org/en/title/60188210)). In the case of the Eleusinian Mysteries, participation was limited to initiates of the cult

Following the festa, I circulated an anonymous online survey targeting attendees/participants (from any year) aged 18+. I interviewed four St Mary of Carmen Society Members (either via phone or Zoom). Their identities will remain anonymous. This research was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.
